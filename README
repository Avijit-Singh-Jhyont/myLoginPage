This project is a simple login page demonstration.
It is quite self explanatory once you execute it in a CLI or IDE(preferrably Intellij) 
Upon execution, a Javafx window will pop up requiring admin credentials(please follow the steps to sign into the application; The credentials stay in
you local RAM as explained upon execution but I still recommend generating a temporary app password for use through your gmail address)
Once credentials are submitted, please go to your localhost:8080 URL page and try registering some users.

Hope you Enjoy :)
